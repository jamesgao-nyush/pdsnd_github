### Project Title
Python: Bikeshare

### Description
With the Bikeshare data sets of 3 cities - New York City, Washington and Chicago,  this program  analyzes the user selected data set and print out the results. It also allow user to review the raw data after the analyzation. 

User will be asked to choose one of the three cities, and then select the filters that they like to apply to current analyzation. The code includes  some error handling method to ensure there is no running error if the user's input is unexpected. 

### Develop and running environment 

The program is wrote and tested in Anaconda 3 (Python 3.7.3 and Pandas 0.24.2)

The Python library **Pandas** is the key function to deal with  the data sets and excute most of analyzatoins.

So you may need to have Python 3.7.x , and library Pandas 0.23 or later to run it.
